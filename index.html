                The Wheel of Time is a fantasy book series written by Robert Jordan. There are thirteen total in the series,
                not including the prequel. The story follows Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara, Mat Cauthon, Egwene al'Vere,
                and Nynaeve al'Meara as they must leave the only place they have ever known when evil forces are after
                them. It is a story about heros and villians, triumphs and defeat, love and loss. It is a huge commitment
                with over 4 million words and thousands of characters throughout the long series. However, it is a classic
                in the genre for a reason, and that reason being it is an amazing story that will have you fell every emotion.
                As you may tell by my quick summary, this is one of my favorite book series. It has even surpassed Harry Potter
                in my rankings which I did not think possible. The Wheel of Time is a fantasy book series written by Robert Jordan. There are thirteen total in the series,
